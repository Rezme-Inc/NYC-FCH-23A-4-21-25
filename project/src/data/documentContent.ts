## Introduction

This document outlines the legal and recommended practices for conducting background checks for employment purposes. Employers must balance their need to make informed hiring decisions with applicants' rights to privacy and fair treatment. The following guidelines are designed to help employers navigate this complex area.

## Legal Framework

Background checks are regulated by various federal, state, and local laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, and state-specific "ban-the-box" laws. Employers must ensure compliance with all applicable regulations.

### Article 23-A Section 4: Criminal History Considerations

When evaluating an applicant with a criminal history, the following factors should be considered:

1. **Time Since Offense**: The time which has elapsed since the occurrence of the criminal offense or offenses. Research indicates that individuals who remain conviction-free for 5-7 years present minimal increased risk compared to those with no criminal history.

2. **Age at Time of Offense**: The age of the person at the time of the occurrence of the criminal offense or offenses. Offenses committed during youth should be viewed in context of developmental factors.

3. **Nature and Severity of Offense**: The specific duties and responsibilities necessarily related to the employment sought or held by the person. Not all offenses are relevant to all positions.

4. **Rehabilitation and Good Conduct**: Evidence of rehabilitation and good conduct, including completion of probation, employment history, character references, and educational achievements.

### Article 23-B Section 2: Relevance to Job Function

Employers should only consider convictions that have a direct relationship to the specific position being sought. When determining job relevance, consider:

1. **Essential Job Functions**: The specific duties and responsibilities of the position
2. **Work Environment**: The setting in which job duties are performed
3. **Supervision Level**: The amount of supervision or independence in the role
4. **Access to Sensitive Information**: Whether the position provides access to financial, personal, or confidential information

### Article 23-C Section 5: Employment History Verification

When verifying employment history, employers should:

1. Verify dates of employment and positions held
2. Confirm salary information only with written consent
3. Inquire about job performance only when relevant to the position
4. Consider gaps in employment in the context of other factors
5. Allow applicants to explain any discrepancies

## Best Practices

### Article 24-A: Individualized Assessment

Employers should conduct an individualized assessment of each applicant, considering:

1. The nature and gravity of the offense
2. The time passed since the offense and/or completion of the sentence
3. The nature of the job sought

### Article 24-B: Consistent Application

Background check policies should be:

1. Applied consistently to all applicants for the same position
2. Documented with clear procedures and evaluation criteria
3. Regularly reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with changing laws

### Article 24-C: Adverse Action Process

When taking adverse action based on background check information:

1. Provide pre-adverse action notice with a copy of the background check report
2. Allow reasonable time (minimum 5 business days) for the applicant to respond
3. Consider any additional information provided by the applicant
4. Provide final adverse action notice if proceeding with the adverse decision

## Special Considerations

### Article 25-A: Credit History

Credit history should only be considered when directly relevant to the position, such as:

1. Roles with fiduciary responsibility
2. Positions with access to significant financial assets
3. Executive positions with financial oversight

### Article 25-B: Social Media Screening

When reviewing social media profiles:

1. Only review publicly available information
2. Do not request passwords or access to private accounts
3. Focus only on job-relevant information
4. Be aware of potential bias in interpretation
5. Document the specific job-related concerns identified

## Conclusion

Background checks are valuable tools for making informed hiring decisions when used properly. By following these guidelines, employers can help ensure they're conducting background checks in a manner that is both legally compliant and fair to applicants.
