        summary: "5-7 years since offense is significant",
        researchInfo: "Research shows that if a person is conviction free for four to seven years or longer, the likelihood of future arrest is about the same as for someone who has never been convicted of a crime.",
        expandedInfo: "Research shows that if a person is conviction free for four to seven years or longer, the likelihood of future arrest is about the same as for someone who has never been convicted of a crime. This time is reduced by the person's involvement in positive activities, including employment, education, and occupational training. Therefore, even for applicants with recent convictions, it is important that the employer consider evidence of rehabilitation and other facts and circumstances that indicate that the applicant does not present a significant risk of re-offending."

        summary: "Not all offenses are relevant to all positions",
        researchInfo: "Employers should only consider offenses that are directly relevant to the specific position being sought.",
        expandedInfo: "The nature and severity of an offense should be evaluated in context of the specific job requirements. Studies show that many offenses have no bearing on job performance for certain roles. For example, a driving offense may be relevant for a delivery position but irrelevant for a desk job. Employers should establish clear guidelines for which types of offenses are relevant to specific positions and document the reasoning. This approach reduces bias in the hiring process and focuses the evaluation on genuine job-related risks."

        summary: "Evidence of rehabilitation shows reduced risk",
        researchInfo: "Evidence of rehabilitation significantly reduces recidivism risk and should be strongly considered in employment decisions.",
        expandedInfo: "Research consistently shows that successful rehabilitation is one of the strongest predictors of reduced recidivism. Factors such as stable employment history, educational achievement, completion of rehabilitation programs, community involvement, and positive character references provide strong evidence of rehabilitation. Studies indicate that individuals who demonstrate these positive factors have recidivism rates comparable to or even lower than the general population within 3-5 years after their offense. Employers who consider rehabilitation evidence make more accurate risk assessments and often discover qualified candidates who might otherwise be overlooked."
